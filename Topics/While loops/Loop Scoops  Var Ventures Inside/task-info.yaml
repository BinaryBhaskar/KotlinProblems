options:
  - text: '&#x27;x&#x27; is accessible outside the while loop because it is initialized
    within the loop.'
  - text: The final value of &#x27;x&#x27; after the loop terminates affects &#x27;x&#x27;
      outside the loop scope.
  - text: '&#x27;x&#x27; is recreated and reinitialized to 5 at the beginning of each
    iteration of the loop.'
  - text: "&#x27;y&#x27;, declared outside the loop, accumulates changes made within\
    \ the loop across iterations."
  - text: The final value of &#x27;y&#x27; can be used outside the loop since it retains
      its value and scope after the loop.
